Dai is the first decentralized stablecoin built on Ethereum by MakerDao.  
The Dai token is based on the [DS-Token](https://dapp.tools/dappsys/ds-token.html) implementation which follow the ERC-20 token standard with minor additions that makes it fit nicely into the Maker system.  
The Dai Stablecoin System involves a series of smart contracts that allows anyone to issue Dai by locking collateral (other valuable crypto assets) into the system.
